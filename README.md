## Objective

The primary aim of this project is to analyze and understand the security landscape of cloud computing, with a particular emphasis on the escalating risks as cloud usage grows. This project serves as an academic exploration to pinpoint potential security hurdles in the adoption of cloud technologies.

## Cloud Computing Basics

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing provides on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources, enabling flexible, scalable, secure, and cost-efficient resource utilization via the internet.

### Types of Cloud Computing

- Public Cloud
- Private Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud

### Services Offered

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

## Cloud Security Essentials

Cloud security involves the implementation of policies, procedures, and technological tools designed to protect data, ensure regulatory compliance, and manage privacy and authentication controls.

### Key Areas to Secure

- Physical networks
- Data storage and servers
- Virtualization frameworks
- Operating systems and middleware
- Runtime environments
- Data and applications
- End-user hardware

## Cloud Attack Surface

This section outlines common attack vectors in cloud environments, such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial of service attacks.

### Types of Attacks

- **Exploiting Weak Credentials**
  - Brute Force Attacks
  - Credential Stuffing
- **Data Breaches**
  - API Key Exposure
  - SQL Injection
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**
  - Distributed DoS (DDoS)
- **Elevation of Privilege**
  - Hypervisor Vulnerabilities
  - Container and VM Escapes
- **Account Takeover**
  - Phishing and Session Hijacking

## Attack Tree
